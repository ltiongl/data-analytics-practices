## Project 1: [Seoul Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/ltiongl/portfolio-projects/tree/main/seoul-bike-sharing)
In this project, I analyze rental bike data from Seoul, covering the period from December 2017 to November 2018.

While the data may be somewhat outdated, I am using it as a practice exercise for my portfolio.
The analytical skills demonstrated here can be applied to similar rental bike datasets, aiding in the planning and management of rental bike systems. This includes ensuring a stable supply of rental bikes, regardless of city location or time.
